# TemPaste Parser

Typescript parser to convert collections of Temtem written in a pokepaste-like text format to javascript objects.

The parser is a syntax parser, it does not validate the Temtem - it does not check that the Temtem can have the traits specified, learn the techniques they are given (or even that the Temtem, traits and techniques actually exist). This is to allow for maximum flexibility.

## Credits

The syntax parsing is adapted from [pokepastes](https://github.com/felixphew/pokepaste/blob/v3/syntax.go).

This repository was inspired by the efforts of others, such as Shoddy Battle, Smogon, Pokemon Showdown, Pikalytics, TemTeam and many many more.
